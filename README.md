##Summary
In this chart, I visualized the mean batting average and total home runs for each height measurement and batting handedness. The y-position of each circle represents the batting average for a given x-position height, the color represents the handedness, and the relative size of the circle represents the total number of home runs. Notice that for right and both handed batters, there is a specific height and batting average where the total HR count is much higher than its other similarly colored circles. Also notice how in general, left handed batters hit a better average and more home runs for a given height than right/both handed batters.

##Design
### Initial Design
I initially tried to represent the relationship between batting averages, handedness, and height with a bar chart. The mean batting average for each height and handedness preference on the x-axis(first height by x-axis location then handedness by bar color). A legend for handedness was placed in the top right. Hovering over a bar would provide the mean average for that specific height and handedness. In addition, I edited the data to remove batting averages of 0, reducing the datapoints from 1157 to 891 (-266).

### Final Design
After collecting feedback, I decided to add a fourth variable, HR to show where left, right, and both handed players performed the best in batting average and total home runs. To visualize this, I decided to switch from a bar graph to a bubble graph for its extra visual dimension (size). In addition, I added gridlines to foster a better visual separation by height. I changed the title to reflect the new variable, and the title font was changed from default Times New Roman to Georgia and was moved from the top left to top center. The y-axis was renamed from 'avg' to 'Batting Average' for cohesiveness.

##Feedback
Here are several feedback comments after showing the first version of the graphic to three individuals:


###What do you notice in the visualization?

* Some heights are missing bars, mostly on the outer ranges of height (65-66 in, 77-80 in).

* The majority of mean batting averages are within 0.01 or 0.02 to 0.250.

* Very tall right handed batters have rather low batting averages.


###What questions do you have about the data?

* It seems like only left handed batters have a lower average with increasing height, why? 

* Why is there no discernable relationship for right/both handed batters?

* How many batters are there for each height and handedness?

* Why do left handers have higher averages for a given height?
  

###What relationships do you notice?

* For left handers, batting averages generally decrease with height.

* For heights with all three batting handedness represented, left handers have a higher mean batting average.


###What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?

* Left handers have somewhat lower batting averages with increasing height, and right/both handed batters have no relationship with height. 

* Left handers have a higher batting average than their right/both handed batters of the same height. 


###Is there something you donâ€™t understand in the graphic? How can it be improved?

* Seems like the lack of data for players 65-66 inches and 77-80 inches makes the graphic misleading. How many players were 79 inches versus 72 inches?

* Make the title stand out more

* Since there's other variables such as weight and HR count, maybe try to incorporate another variable to get a better picture.
